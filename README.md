#### Log

To improve knowledge sharing and experimentation, please document how to build and run your code. It can also be nice to keep a log here:

##### 30/11

I am planning to complete the Advent of Code using [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/). Rust is still fairly new for me, so we'll see how this goes...

To run my code:
- install Rust toolchain: https://www.rust-lang.org/install.html
- make sure `cargo` is in your path
- `cd` into directory
- compile and run the program: `$ cargo run`

##### 01/12

This was a fairly easy challenge to start with: mostly reading files, iterating over lists...

I learned some more about error handling (though I kept it simple) and command line input.

Refactored the code using iterators and closures.
